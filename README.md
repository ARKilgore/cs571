CS571: Natural Language Processing
=====

This is a graduate course in computer science, studying topics in natural Language processing. This course covers core natural language processing tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition, and coreference resolution as well as machine learning algorithms such as structured perceptron, adaptive subgradient descent, softmax regression, and backpropagation. Advanced topics such as distributional semantics and deep learning are also discussed. Prerequisites: undergraduate level of artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, information retrieval, or their equivalence.
